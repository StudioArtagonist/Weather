Just started working on android projects, this is just the beginning....

The project name is "Weather". It's just a weather app. It has real time datas with dynamic interaction.

Things I have used (APIs) for making this app:

* Open Weather Map API
      
          # Current Weather Data
          # 5 days / 3 hours Forecast

* Retrofit2 (REST API) for retreive and upload JSON datas

Libraries that i have used for making this app:

* Glide library for image data collection of various weathers and icons
* Persistent Search View library by "mars885" for simplify the process of implementing search-related functionality.
